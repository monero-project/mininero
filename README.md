MiniNero
========

This repository contains code used to prototype research for the cryptocurrency Monero. Also, there will occasionally be some drafts of math research related to various experimental extensions of the protocol. This written up research is hashed into the blockchain for timestamping purposes. 

For current Ring CT code in python, I have separated this out in the following repository:

For current Ring CT code in c++, I have refactored this in the following repository:

#Note:
MiniNero is also the name for the suite of mobile monero wallets with [xmr.to](https://xmr.to/) integration. 

[MiniNero Web: React-based web-wallet and NodeJS server](https://github.com/shennoether/mininodo)

[MiniNero Universal: Windows 10 Mobile Wallet in C#](https://github.com/shennoether/MiniNeroUniversal)

[MiniNero Droid: Android Mobile Wallet in Java](https://github.com/shennoether/MiniNeroDroid)

The name "MiniNero" is chosen because these apps aim to provide a light-weight, easy-to-use Monero experience.
